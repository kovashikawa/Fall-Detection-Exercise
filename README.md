# Fall Detection Challenge

## Overview

This challenge requires you to develop a model that can detect falls from time-series data collected from body-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. The data includes acceleration, angular velocity, and magnetic field readings from seven different body locations. The goal is to build a robust and accurate fall detection system.

## Dataset

You can download the full dataset here [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rr5eI8btUAKqDjmDc2vxRyu0C0yRX1Xl](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rr5eI8btUAKqDjmDc2vxRyu0C0yRX1Xl).  Note: You don't have to train on all of the data if you don't need to.  
The dataset used in this challenge is designed for benchmarking fall detection and prediction algorithms. It includes data from APDM Opal IMU sensors at the following body locations:

* Right ankle
* Left ankle
* Right thigh
* Left thigh
* Head
* Sternum
* Waist

###   Data Description

* The dataset contains data from 8 subjects.
* The subjects are healthy young adults with ages ranging from 22 to 32 years (mean = 26.6, standard deviation = 2.8).
* Each subject performed 60 trials, including Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), Falls, and Near Falls.
* The experiment environment was designed to simulate realistic activity primitives.
* Fall and near-fall trials were conducted on a 30-cm-thick gymnasium mattress with a 13-cm top layer of high-density ethylene vinyl acetate foam to ensure safety.
* Subjects were trained with representative videos for fall events.
* Near-fall and ADL events were performed without video guidance, with instructions to simulate scenarios involving frailer older adults.

###   Folder Structure

The dataset is organized as follows:

* Each folder (e.g., `sub1`, `sub2`, ..., `sub8`) corresponds to one subject.
* Each subfolder (e.g., `ADLs`, `Falls`, `Near_Falls`) corresponds to the type of trial.
* Each file (`.xlsx`) contains sensor data for a single trial.

3.  **Evaluation:**
    * Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy).
    * Pay close attention to class imbalance (if present) and choose metrics accordingly.
    * Provide a clear explanation of the model's performance.

4.  **Reporting:**
