# Fall-Detection-Exercise
This challenge requires you to develop a model that can detect falls from time-series data collected from body-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. The data includes acceleration, angular velocity, and magnetic field readings from seven different body locations. The goal is to build a robust and accurate fall detection system.
